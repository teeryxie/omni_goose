# SocialOmni-Goose v1 Leaderboard Core

This directory is the paper/leaderboard-grade core split derived from the full SocialOmni-Goose v1 benchmark.

Inclusion policy:

- Include all A_pre_reveal_belief, B_post_reveal_reconstruct_previous_belief, and C_other_agent_false_belief trials.
- Include D_perspective_taking_prediction only when the diagnostic hidden gold has behavior_checked_public_scope=true.
- Exclude ungrounded D trials from leaderboard scoring until independent public behavior or response evidence is human verified.

Files:

- trials.jsonl: public model-facing core trials, no hidden scorer answers.
- gold.jsonl: scorer-visible gold metadata.
- private_gold.jsonl: scorer-only hidden gold. Do not release to model participants.
- interactive_prompts.jsonl: core interactive diagnostic prompts.
- probe_groups.jsonl: probe groups with core inclusion policy annotations.
- excluded_D_ungrounded.jsonl: D trials kept in the extended benchmark but excluded from leaderboard-core scoring.

## Pass241 adjudication

All 84 D_perspective_taking_prediction trials excluded from leaderboard-core were individually adjudicated in pass241. The per-trial records live in `excluded_D_ungrounded.jsonl` and the internal diagnostic audit is `annotations_evaluated_model/diagnostics/review/d_ungrounded_adjudication_pass241.jsonl`.
